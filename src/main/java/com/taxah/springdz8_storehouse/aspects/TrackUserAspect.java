/**
 * TrackUserAspect Class
 * <p>
 * This class implements an aspect in Spring framework to track user actions.
 * It is annotated with @Aspect to indicate that it is an aspect.
 * <p>
 * Usage:
 * - Annotate methods that need to be tracked with @TrackUserAction from com.taxah.spring_dz5.aspects package.
 * - The aspect will log the execution of methods annotated with @TrackUserAction after their execution.
 * <p>
 * The above method execution will be logged by TrackUserAspect after its execution.
 * <p>
 * Methods:
 * - logExecution: A method annotated with @After and listens for methods annotated with @TrackUserAction.
 * It logs the execution of such methods after their execution.
